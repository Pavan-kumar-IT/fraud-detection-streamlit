A Credit Card Fraud Detection App using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit.

# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning & Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Credit Card Fraud Detection Web App** built using **Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit**.  
It predicts whether a transaction is **Legitimate** or **Fraudulent** based on historical transaction data.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- Features: Transaction details (V1–V28), normalized amount  
- Target: `Class` (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Streamlit 🎨
- Pandas & NumPy 📊
- Matplotlib 📈

## 🚀 Features
- **Manual Input**: Enter transaction values to predict fraud.  
- **CSV Upload**: Upload transaction data and get fraud predictions.  
- **Dataset Visualization**: View fraud distribution and charts.
